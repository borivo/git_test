My solution for Google Homepage cloning in response to the assignment request from The Odin Project.

Some of the icons i used are not the ones Google uses (microphone, app icon) but i had hard time finding ones that had more resemblance. 
I did not use the original Google logo, i probably should have though. 
It's done with HTML and CSS only.
